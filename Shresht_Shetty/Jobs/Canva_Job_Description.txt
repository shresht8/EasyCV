Company: Canva

Company Overview: 
We're a global online visual communications platform on a mission to empower the world to design. Featuring a simple drag-and-drop user interface and a vast range of templates ranging from presentations, documents, websites, social media graphics, posters, apparel to videos, plus a huge library of fonts, stock photography, illustrations, video footage, and audio clips, anyone can take an idea and create something beautiful on Canva on any device, from anywhere in the world.

Since our launch in 2013, we’ve had the crazy big goal of making design accessible to everyone. We were founded on the belief that people shouldn't need to understand complex software to unlock their creativity. We’re leveling the playing field and democratizing access to design and visual communication by empowering 100% of the world to communicate in a way that was once limited to the 1%. 

We've always had a deeper mission surrounding Canva — which we talk about as our 'simple' two-step plan: to build one of the world’s most valuable companies, and to do the most good we possibly can. We're committed to our core value of Being a Force for Good, so as the value of our company grows, so too does our ability to have a positive impact on the world.
