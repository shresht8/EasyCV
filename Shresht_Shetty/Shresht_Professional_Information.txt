Experience

Data Scientist - BlueSky Creations (logo file: bsc.jpg)
August 2021 - Present (2 years 3 months)

-Built production scale optimzation software for one of Australia's biggest grocery chains to automate their distribution center operations. 
-Built conversational chatbots for company platform using LLMs and Langchain. 
-Built Optimization models such as transport routing, workforce optimization, operation theatre block scheduling models for the company platform.

Research Assistant - The University of Queensland (logo file: uq.jpg)
Jan 2020 - Aus 2021 (1 year 8 months)

Conducted multiple experiments to study the impact of demographics on insurance fraud. In addition, studied the effect of insurance plan switching on spending. Furthermore, I used supervised machine learning models in python to study the effect of plan switching on expenditure. 
-Used Principal component analysis to identify fraudulent claims from insurance claims. Identified the top 10% claims had high suspicion levels.
-Conducted various hypothesis tests to understand the difference in suspicion levels between different groups of people.
-Worked through the data science pipeline that included cleaning data, manipulating data, regression analysis and testing.
- Deployed the logistic regression model to study the effect plan switching has on expenditure.


Machine Learning Engineer Intern - CRiskCo (logo file: criskco.jpg)
Jun 2019 - April 2020 (11 months)

Formed supervised machine learning credit risk models using random forest to identify defaulting companies:
-Achieved a Recall of 100% and precision of 16.3% in identifying defaulting companies
-Worked with cleaning of data and imputation of missing values: 
 Non temporal features: MICE imputation and KNN imputation
 Temporal features: Kalman smoothing, LOCF imputation
-Used machine learning techniques such as undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE sampling to handle the class imbalance.
-Calculated Probability of Default (PD) for all companies, which indicates their creditworthiness.


Data Officer - UQ Business School (logo file: uq_bs.png)
March 2019 - June 2019 (4 months)

Collaborated with the marketing team at UQ Business school to improve the data collection and segmentation process for their client, Queensland Treasury Corporation.
-Analyzed and streamlined the data collection process for CRM data.
-Imputed missing values, standardized the dataset to a single format for ease of use.
-Manipulated data in 20+ databases to create a master database to reduce redundancy.
-Delivered a technical presentation to the client that identified faults in their data collection system and included suggestions for improvement. The presentation also contained complex visualisations on segmentation of customers for effective e- marketing.
